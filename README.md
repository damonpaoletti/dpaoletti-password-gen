# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Password Generator

A Password Generator created in HTML,CSS, and Javascript. An easy way to create a unique password with lowercase letters, Uppercase letters, Numbers, and special characters. It was created using various javascript objects such as arrays and functions such as Math.floor and Math.Random. I learned a lot about coding with Javascript with this project and it was a great way to put all the new tools I learned in class to use.
